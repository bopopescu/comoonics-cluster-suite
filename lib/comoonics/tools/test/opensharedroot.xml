                    This utility will go through and collect some detailed information
                    about the hardware and setup of your $release_name system.
                    This information will be used to diagnose problems with your system
                    and will be considered confidential information.  Red Hat will use
                    this information for diagnostic purposes ONLY.

                    Please wait while we collect information about your system.

                    This process may take a while to complete....
                    No changes will be made to your system during this process.

                    NOTE: You can safely ignore a failed message. This only means a file
                    we were checking for did not exist.

                    If your system hangs while gathering rpm information, please abort
                    the script with CTRL-C and run it again after adding -norpm to the
                    sysreport command line
